# Evolution *in silico* Lab 4.2 - Genetic Programing pt 2
## Overview
By the end of this lab, you'll have a fully functional Genetic Programing framework! 

In the last lab, you saw how programs can be represented as trees, and hopefully got to implement a few more function nodes. Now we'll see how to recursively build tree-based programs, and create classes for our individuals and population of GP Trees. **You'll have to write a selection function that works, but then you'll get to decide what the fitness function looks like!**

This will get you a 9/10 on the lab, try your hand at some of the Next Steps for the last 10 percentage points.
### Next Steps
After you get a selection function that works, try changing the fitness function to something empirical! Maybe get the temperature of Michigan over the past 10 years, or the COVID case counts on campus. You could also try your hand at better mutation operations and/or recombination! 

Maybe check if losing diversity is an issue in your populations. You'll have to decide ***which kind*** of diversity is the right one to be looking at (diversity of genotypes, phenotypes, or some combination of the two). 

### Stretch Goals
Use your genetic program to evolve a strategy for playing a game, perhaps tic-tac-toe? You could imagine having variables representing the state of each of the 9 positions. You could even pit the individuals in the population against one another! 

This could even be the start of a final project.
