# Evolution *in silico* Lab 4.2 - Genetic Programing pt 2
## Overview
By the end of this lab, you'll have a fully functional Genetic Programing framework! 

In the last lab, you saw how programs can be represented as trees, and hopefully got to implement a few more function nodes. Now we'll see how to recursively build tree-based programs, and create classes for our individuals and population of GP Trees. ** You'll have to write a selection function that works, but then you'll get to decide what the fitness function looks like! **

This will get you a 9/10 on the lab, try your hand at some of the Next Steps for the last 10 points.
### Next Steps
After you get a selection function that works, and you've tried changing the fitness function to something more interesting (maybe sin(x) or a heartbeat signal), try your hand at better mutation operations and/or recombination! 

See if you can figure out if losing diversity is an issue in your populations. You'll have to decide ***which kind*** of diversity is the right one to be looking at (diversity of genotypes, phenotypes, or some combination of the two). 

### Stretch Goals
Use your genetic program to evolve a strategy for playing a game, perhaps tic-tac-toe? You could imagine having variables representing the state of each of the 9 positions. You could even pit the individuals in the population against one another! 

This could even be the start of a final project.
